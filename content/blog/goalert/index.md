I havenâ€™t had any work experience yet but I have been contributing to an open source GoAlert project for several months now.
I was given contribution guidelines that I needed to follow to set up the development environment. I am working on the frontend part which is to convert class based components to hooks where I have about 13 pull requests merged.

Working on this project introduced me to the use of Go language to make faster projects and understandable code. I also got to understand some benefits of using docker to automate the development, deployment and running of applications inside isolated containers. It creates containers that allow developers to bundle up an application with all of the parts it needs, such as libraries and other dependencies, and ship it as one package.
