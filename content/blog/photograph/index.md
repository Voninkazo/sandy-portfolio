I developed this page from scratch using semantic HTML, CSS3 and SASS to create a responsive webpage following BEM notation. I also used some Javascript functionalities to make images slide. It has a menu on mobile that works nicely. Building this project helped me understand the real benefits of using BEM to write class names and write less CSS using SASS as a css preprocessor.
