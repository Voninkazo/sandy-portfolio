    ## Quick Start ðŸš€

1.  **Create a Gatsby site.**
    Use the Gatsby CLI to create a new site, specifying the default starter.
    ```sh
    # create a new Gatsby site using the-plain-gatsby starter
    gatsby new portfolio-gatsby https://github.com/Voninkazo/portfolio-gatsby
    ```
2.  **Start developing.**
    Navigate into your new site's directory and start it up.
    ```sh
    cd portfolio-gatsby/
    gatsby develop
    ```
3.  **Open the source code and start editing!**
    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!
    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._
